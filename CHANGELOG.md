## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Clickable Codex banked resets in CLIProxyAPI mode, with account-specific
  confirmation, expiry-ordered credit selection, and idempotent retry handling.

- Proxy Limits now shows all connected accounts together with separate quota
  cards, automatic provider discovery, weekly limits by default, and Codex Pro
  20×/5× plan labels.
- Hide account emails setting, enabled by default, with numbered account labels.
- Antigravity model-group quotas, Codex code-review windows, explicit paused and
  unsupported states, and last-known readings with stale refresh notices.
- Gear-accessible settings menu with Save/Cancel, CLIProxyAPI configuration,
  monitoring and menu-bar visibility controls for each provider, display mode,
  refresh interval, and quota warning thresholds.
- Masked Management API key input with automatic private storage, key replacement,
  and preservation of the existing key when the field is left blank.
- CLIProxyAPI quota source for managed Claude, Codex, and Kimi accounts, with
  server/key-file settings, multi-account capacity selection, partial-check
  notices, and separate per-server history. Local transcript costs remain independent.

### Security

- Bound provider HTTP and local JSON inputs, and replaced Codex RPC `readline`
  handling with a deadline-aware incremental reader capped per message.
- Stream and cap recurring QML backend output while discarding stderr instead
  of retaining complete process streams in the long-lived shell.
- Bound transcript line/file/scan sizes, per-file and total usage records,
  persisted scan caches, model names, and output model groups; limit breaches
  now produce explicit partial/failed coverage instead of unbounded growth.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Omarchy-native quota monitoring for Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Kimi Code.
- Persistent 24-hour and seven-day quota history.
- On-demand local transcript scanning with 24-hour, seven-day, and 30-day
  token activity and API-equivalent cost estimates.
- Failure-isolated provider collection, private XDG state, offline price-cache
  fallback, and explicit partial/unavailable pricing states.
- Keyboard navigation, namespaced IPC, compact percentage chips, and support
  for horizontal and vertical bars.
- Fixture, contract, QML lint, and live Quickshell runtime tests.
